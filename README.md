# SofkaU-Ping-pong 

A ping pong game was developed, using HTML, JS, and CSS for Sofka U's JS workshop. This game consists of a board with two side bars and a ball that bounces between them. The bars have upward or downward movement independently of each other.  To see how it works you can open index.html in the chrome browser and follow the instructions.

Goog game!!
